## 2. License grant (narrow scope)

Subject to this license, the rightsholder gives you a **non-exclusive**, **non-transferable**, **revocable**, **worldwide** license to:

1. **Read** the source code.
2. **Build** **unmodified** Docker images from the unmodified Software.
3. **Run** those Docker images in your own environments.
4. **Distribute internally** the unmodified Docker images within your own organization (non-commercial).

> **Note:** Runtime configuration changes (e.g., env vars, secrets, start params) **do not** count as code modifications and are allowed.

## 3. Explicitly prohibited

Without prior **written** consent from the rightsholder, you **may not**:

* **Modify the source**, edit it, create derivatives, fork it, or distribute modified versions;

## 5. Third-party libraries

The Software may include or rely on third-party libraries. Their **own licenses** still apply and must be followed **in addition**. If there’s a conflict between this license and a third-party license, the third-party license governs that component.
